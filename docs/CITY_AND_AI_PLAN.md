# City Generator + Moot AI Plan

Replaces the straight-corridor world in `lib/world/ground.js` and `lib/world/buildings.js`
with a procedurally generated small city, gives moots ambient pedestrian behavior, and
adds an alert/flee/armed/recovery state machine so they don't run forever.

## Three pillars

1. **City** — non-grid streets + alleys + sidewalks + building footprints
2. **Navigation** — one shared nav grid. Truck CAN drive alleys but may wedge itself
   on tight turns; moots are guaranteed reachable space everywhere they spawn. Asymmetric
   meshes (truck-mesh ≠ moot-mesh) were considered and rejected — they make moots flee
   into pockets the truck can't follow but might also have edge-case orphaned cells.
3. **AI** — `unaware → alarmed-(flee|armed) → recovering → unaware`

## Non-goals (this pass)

- Traffic (cars on the streets)
- Day/night
- Multiple districts with distinct visual styles
- Recast/Detour. Uniform grid + A* is plenty at this scale.

```

## Phase 0 — Generator skeleton (non-breaking)

Add `lib/world/city/generator.js` that returns the same shape `main.js` already needs,
but for a single-block "city". Swap-in without touching `main.js`.

Output bundle:
```js
{
  roadSegments,   // [{ a:{x,z}, b:{x,z}, width, kind: 'street'|'alley' }]
  intersections,  // [{ pos:{x,z}, segmentIds:[…] }]
  sidewalkPolys,  // [{ contour:[{x,z}, …] }]
  buildingAABBs,  // existing shape — main.js consumes today
  interestPoints, // [{ x, z, kind: 'corner'|'crossing'|'doorway' }]
  bounds,         // { minX, minZ, maxX, maxZ }
}
```

`buildBuildings()` becomes a thin adapter that calls `generateCity()` and returns
just `buildingAABBs` until Phase 1 lands.

## Phase 1 — Real city layout

### Algorithm: perturbed grid + planned hierarchical organic roads + alley pass

1. **Primary grid backbone** — deterministic perturbed grid lines remain the
   block/plot scaffold and are tier-promoted into local, 2-lane, and 4-lane
   roads. Zone sampling changes spacing so urban districts are tighter while
   suburban/rural/park/shore edges breathe.
2. **Planned organic hierarchy** — the former Voronoi street overlay is replaced
   by intentional non-grid roads:
   - **Waterfront collectors** follow the deterministic shoreline at an inland
     offset so the city wraps around bays instead of treating water as a straight
     map edge.
   - **Circuit collectors** follow the inside of the elevated beltway at street
     level, giving the highway a readable surface-road counterpart without
     intersecting the reserved highway corridor.
   - **Radial arterials** run inward from the circuit collector toward the city
     core, with optional short waterfront spurs attempted where reservations
     allow.
   - **District local streets** use zone-scaled spacing/density: urban locals are
     shorter/tighter, suburban locals are moderate, and rural locals are sparse.
3. **Snapping and intersection control** — every planned road endpoint snaps to a
   coarse grid, nearby existing nodes, or the retained grid backbone. New segment
   crossings are rejected when they create cramped intersections or acute angles,
   preventing the short wedge intersections produced by raw Voronoi bisectors.
4. **Reservation filtering** — water and highway reservations are treated as hard
   masks before roads, alleys, plots, boundary blockers, and nav cells are
   accepted. Ramp feeder roads are explicit street-level segments so nav can keep
   them walkable while the elevated highway remains reserved.
5. **Alley pass** — for every block longer than ~30 m, insert one alley parallel
   to the long side at a 35–65% offset. Width 3–4 m.
6. **Block extraction** — find closed polygons formed by the grid scaffold; each
   polygon is a "block" for plotting.
7. **Plots** — BSP-split each block: pick the longest edge, split perpendicular
   at 40–60%, recurse until area < threshold. One footprint per leaf, inset from
   plot edges and filtered away from planned organic roads/reservations.
8. **Sidewalks** — strips along every non-alley road plus organic-road sidewalk
   strips/interest points, excluding beach, water, and highway reservation zones.

**Voronoi usage**: Voronoi is no longer used to emit street segments. It remains
appropriate for optional *district partitioning* (different block-size,
alley-density, population, or building-height profiles) because district cells do
not create the constant wedge intersections that Voronoi street edges did.

**Why not full Citygen agent-based road growth yet**: 5× the code. Defer to
Phase 7 if perturbed grid feels too regular.

### Why alleys are truck-drivable

Per the "moots never get stuck due to nav asymmetry" decision: nav grid is
shared. Alley tightness becomes a *physics* punishment (turning radius +
collision wedges the truck) rather than a *navigation* prohibition. Moots
prefer alleys when fleeing because cost is lower (see Phase 2), not because
the truck can't enter them.

## Phase 2 — Single nav grid

One uniform grid over the city bounds.

- Cell size: 0.5 m (tunable; 200×200 m city → 400×400 = 160k cells).
- **Walkable**: cell center on road, alley, sidewalk, or intersection AND not
  inside any building AABB inflated by `mootRadius`.
- **Cost multiplier** per cell:
  - sidewalk: 1.0
  - road (along): 1.0
  - road crossing (intersection cell flagged crossing): 1.3
  - alley: **0.7** ← makes flee paths prefer alleys
- A* in `lib/nav/pathfind.js` with octile heuristic; preallocate open/closed
  arrays, reuse across plans. Cap to N replans per frame (round-robin) so a
  burst of state changes doesn't spike frame time.

The truck does **not** pathfind. It still uses `resolveBuildingCollisions`
against `buildingAABBs` exactly as today. The grid is for moot AI only.

### Moot ↔ wall collision

Today only the truck collides. Add a small movement helper used by every state:
circle-vs-AABB resolution against `buildingAABBs` with `moot.collisionRadius`
(≈ 0.4 m). All states (`ambient`, `flee`, `armed`) call it after computing
desired velocity.

## Phase 3 — Unaware state (ambient pedestrians)

Each moot starts `unaware`:
- Picks a destination from `interestPoints` 30–100 m away on the nav grid
- Pathfinds, walks the path at 1.2 m/s
- On arrival, picks another destination
- Crossing intersections: just walks the path; intersection cells already have
  the elevated cost so paths naturally prefer along-sidewalk routes.

No truck-awareness yet — perception comes online in Phase 4.

`lib/ai/ambient.js` exports `tickUnaware(dt, moot, ctx)` where `ctx` carries
the nav grid, AABBs, interest points.

## Phase 4 — Perception + transitions

`lib/ai/perception.js` runs per moot per frame (or every other frame,
round-robin to amortize raycasts).

Threat score (0..1, decays −0.4/s when no input):

| Signal                                              | Add  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|------|
| Truck within 25 m AND has LOS                       | +0.6 |
| Truck within 8 m regardless of LOS                  | +0.8 |
| Truck velocity toward moot > 6 m/s                  | +0.3 |
| A moot was killed within 15 m in last 4 s           | +0.5 |
| Heard gunshot within 30 m                           | +0.3 |

LOS = single raycast against `buildingAABBs` (cheap, top-down 2D segment vs
AABB list).

Transitions:
- `unaware` + threat ≥ 0.5 → `alarmed-flee` (or `alarmed-armed` if `moot.armed`)
- `alarmed-*` + threat < 0.15 for 5 s + truck dist > 50 m → `recovering`
- `recovering` + 8 s elapsed without re-alarm → `unaware`
- `recovering` + threat ≥ 0.5 → back to `alarmed-*` immediately

The "they flee forever" bug = recovering state never existed. This phase
adds it.

**Boss exception**: the boss skips this perception system entirely. Once the
player enters its detect radius once, aggro is permanent — see Phase 9.

## Phase 5 — Flee + armed + recovery behaviors

### `alarmed-flee`
- Goal node = nav cell that maximizes `(distance from truck) − 0.5×(distance from moot)`,
  sampled from a ring 30–60 m from the moot, prefer cells whose path crosses
  alley-cost cells.
- Replan every 0.5–1.0 s while truck is in sight.
- Run speed 4.5 m/s.
- Existing `updateMootFlee` is the seed for this — port its math into `flee.js`.

### `alarmed-armed`
- Stop, face truck, fire — `updateMootGunfire` already does this; just gate
  it on state.
- If truck closes within 6 m: drop to `alarmed-flee`.
- If truck loses LOS for 2 s: hold position 1 s then `recovering`.

### `recovering`
- Walk (not run) to nearest interest point.
- Glance back: every 1 s, if truck has LOS, threat += 0.2 (so it'll re-alarm).
- After 8 s clean → `unaware`, pick a new ambient destination.

**Boss exception**: boss never enters `recovering`. See Phase 9.

## Phase 6 — Radar HUD

`lib/hud/radar.js` — canvas2D overlay, ~140×140 px, bottom-right corner.

- Truck = center, points up
- Moot dot per state:
  - gray   = unaware
  - yellow = alarmed-flee
  - red    = alarmed-armed
  - green  = recovering (fading)
- Range 40 m, fade dots near edge
- Render every 4–5 frames

## Phase 7 — Optional polish

- Voronoi over the city seed → district regions, varied block size /
  alley density / building height range per district.
- Citygen-style agent road growth if the perturbed grid feels too regular.
- Crowd density variation by district.
- Per-state animation hooks on `mootHandles[i]` (idle bob vs run vs cower).

## Phase 8 — Standing population manager

Replaces the corridor-era "spawn N moots once and forget" model. The city has
a *steady-state* population around the player; far moots despawn, fresh ones
spawn nearby. Death triggers an immediate respawn elsewhere — net population
is constant.

### Constants (`lib/config.js → POP`)

```js
POP = {
  standing: 60,            // active moot count
  despawnRadius: 300,      // m — moots beyond this are removed
  spawnRingMin: 150,       // m — new moots appear in [min, max] from player
  spawnRingMax: 250,
  spawnVisCheck: true,     // skip cells visible to camera (avoid pop-in)
  tickHz: 2,               // run despawn/spawn pass twice per second
};
```

### Spawn

- Pick random sidewalk `interestPoint` within `[spawnRingMin, spawnRingMax]`
  of the player.
- If `spawnVisCheck`: rejection-sample if the point is in camera frustum AND
  not occluded by buildings (keeps spawn out of view).
- Pick a moot row from `db.regulars` (db partitioned at level start, see
  Phase 9). Cycle through the pool so the same row doesn't reappear in
  rapid succession.

### Despawn

- Tick at `POP.tickHz`, not every frame.
- Remove any non-boss moot beyond `despawnRadius` from the player.
- Return its `mootHandle` to the resource pool.

### Death respawn

- HP → 0 ⇒ despawn at next tick AND queue a respawn at a fresh location.
- Boss is exempt — boss death = victory, not respawn.

### Resource pool

- Pre-allocate `POP.standing + 8` `mootHandle` records (geometry, materials).
- On despawn: reset transform, hide, return to pool.
- On spawn: pull from pool, swap avatar texture, place at world coords,
  insert into active set.

### Bootstrap order (replaces Phase 1's "place all moots in a corridor")

1. Generate city
2. Pick player spawn (random sidewalk node near a map edge)
3. Pick boss spawn (Phase 9 rule — halfway to opposite edge)
4. Initialize pool, spawn `POP.standing` regulars in the spawn ring
5. Spawn the boss at its computed point
6. Begin loop

## Phase 9 — Boss target + level loop

### Boss as a tuned moot

Same code path as regulars, with overrides:

| Field            | Boss value                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `hp`             | `BOSS.hp = 100`                           |
| `scale`          | `1.5×` regular                            |
| `tint`           | red multiplier on avatar material         |
| `armed`          | always true                               |
| `state`          | locked: never `unaware`, never `recovering` |
| `respawn`        | never (death = victory)                   |
| `pool`           | excluded from `db.regulars`               |

### Aggro model — distance only, never breaks

User intent: "lose sight is determined by distance, not by line of sight",
"the boss will try to give chase until they lose sight, but they will never
lose agro".

- Once the player enters `BOSS.detectRadius` (suggest 80 m): aggro = true,
  permanent. Aggro is a one-way latch.
- Two sub-modes while aggroed (no LOS check anywhere):
  - **Engage** — player within `BOSS.engageRadius` (60 m): kite + fire.
    Maintain `BOSS.kiteDistance` ≈ 25 m (back away if too close, hold if at
    range, advance if too far). Replan every 0.5 s. Fire on existing gunfire
    cadence.
  - **Pursue** — player beyond `engageRadius`: path along nav grid toward
    last known player position. Replan every 1.0 s. No firing.
- The "lost sight" the user described is just `dist > engageRadius` — boss
  pursues, doesn't disengage.

### Spawn placement

- At generator time, after picking player spawn:
  - Find nearest map edge from player spawn → unit vector
  - Boss spawn = player spawn + 0.5 × (edge − player spawn), snapped to
    nearest sidewalk nav cell
  - Reject if not on a valid walkable cell — search outward for nearest valid
    cell.

### Damage rules

- Pistol: `PISTOL.damage = 10` (boss takes 10 hits)
- Ram: `RAM.damage = clamp(speed * k, 0, 50)` (tune later, never one-shots)
- Damage applies to boss the same as regulars, except:
  - **Ramming the boss does not refund ammo** (special case in the ram refund path)

### Ammo economy (codified)

The whole-joke rule from the user:

| Action            | Ammo effect                |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| Shoot (any)       | `ammo -= 1` always         |
| Ram regular       | `ammo += AMMO.ramRefund`   |
| Ram boss          | no change                  |
| Anything else     | no change                  |

No pickups, no regen, no other source. Out-of-ammo is fine — player can still
ram. (Out-of-ammo + boss = the player must eat ram damage to refill on
regulars, then come back.)

### Health & capacitors (clarifying existing mechanic)

User: "no health recovery. They have to fill a capacitor and that only gives
them one health back after they are killed."

This matches the existing rewind: `game.capacitors > 0` + death → rewind to
before the kill = effectively 1 HP back. Treat the existing
`recorder`/`playback` system as the implementation. Filling a capacitor
should be tied to kills (current rule presumably already does this — verify
in `lib/game/state.js` during Phase 9 work).

### Identification

- HUD portrait: top-right boss avatar + HP bar (`lib/hud/portrait.js`,
  styling TBD)
- Radar: distinct dot — flashing red, larger
- In-world: 1.5× scale and red tint already make the boss visibly distinct
  in a crowd at close-to-medium range
- (Optional later: directional arrow on the radar edge when boss is off-radar)

### Level transitions

- `boss.hp <= 0` → `game.state = 'victory'`
- Play victory animation (camera pull-back / slow-mo / TBD art pass)
- After delay → `nextLevel()`:
  - Dispose city geometry, nav grid, mesh pool
  - Increment seed
  - Generate new city, pick spawns, spawn population, place new boss
  - **Carry forward**: ammo count, capacitor count, collection list
  - **Reset**: HP to full, boss-related state

### Boss row selection

- DB partition at level start: `{ boss: rowX, regulars: db \ rowX }`
- (Optional) eligibility filter: e.g. only rows with `has_chibi`, or a
  curated `boss_eligible` flag
- Track recent boss rows in localStorage so the same moot isn't boss two
  levels in a row.

### City sizing — note on the 2-mile target

User target: ~2 miles (3.2 km). Memory + perf caveats:

| Cell size | Cells (2 mi)    | walkable (bytes) | costMul (Float32) | Verdict   |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| 0.5 m     | 41 M            | 41 MB            | 164 MB            | infeasible|
| 1.0 m     | 10 M            | 10 MB            | 41 MB             | borderline|
| 1.5 m     | 4.6 M           | 4.6 MB           | 18 MB             | OK        |
| 2.0 m     | 2.6 M           | 2.6 MB           | 10 MB             | comfortable|

Recommendation: at 2-mile scale, nav cells must be ≥ 1.5 m. Building meshes
must be instanced and frustum-culled or drawcalls explode.

**Suggested rollout**: prototype at **1 km × 1 km** (boss ~500 m from
player — already feels big in a Three.js game). Validate AI, despawn loop,
nav grid perf there. Scale toward 2 miles once perf is proven; that scale-up
becomes a Phase 7 polish item.

## Extended moot record

```js
{
  // existing
  group, avatarMat, position, armed, …
  // new
  state: 'unaware' | 'alarmed-flee' | 'alarmed-armed' | 'recovering',
  threat: 0,                 // 0..1
  path: [],                  // [{x,z}, …] in world coords
  pathIndex: 0,
  destination: null,         // {x,z} or null
  lastReplanAt: 0,
  lastSeenTruckAt: 0,        // ms
  stateEnteredAt: 0,
  collisionRadius: 0.4,
}
```

## Nav grid record

```js
{
  cellSize: 0.5,
  cols, rows,
  origin: { x, z },          // world-space position of cell (0,0) center
  walkable: Uint8Array,      // cols*rows, 0 = blocked
  costMul: Float32Array,     // 1.0 default, 0.7 alley, 1.3 crossing
  interestPoints: [{ x, z, kind }],
}
```

## Decisions (resolved)

1. **City size.** Prototype at **1 km × 1 km**, scale toward 2 miles in Phase 7
   once perf is validated. See Phase 9 sizing table.
2. **Moot count.** Flat **`POP.standing = 60`** active moots. Despawn beyond
   300 m, respawn in 150–250 m ring. `GAME.sessionMoots` (corridor-era) goes
   away — it's superseded by Phase 8.
3. **Truck spawn.** Random sidewalk node near a map edge (chosen at level
   generation time).
4. **Boss spawn.** Halfway from player spawn toward the nearest opposite
   edge, snapped to nearest sidewalk cell.
5. **Loading.** Generator + nav grid bake + initial 60-moot spawn must finish
   before play. Profile after Phase 8 (1 km scale should be fine).
6. **Seed.** `?seed=` URL param at minimum; level system manages seeds across
   levels (`seed += 1` on `nextLevel`).

## Files this plan creates / modifies

**Create:**
- `lib/world/city/{generator,roads,blocks,buildings,sidewalks,intersections}.js`
- `lib/nav/{grid,pathfind}.js`
- `lib/ai/{perception,states,ambient,flee,armed,recovery,boss}.js`
- `lib/world/population.js` — Phase 8 standing population manager
- `lib/game/levels.js` — Phase 9 level seed + transition logic
- `lib/hud/radar.js`
- `lib/hud/portrait.js` — Phase 9 boss portrait + HP bar

**Modify:**
- `main.js` — call generator instead of `buildBuildings`; install nav grid;
  AI dispatch replaces direct `updateMootFlee` / `updateMootGunfire` calls;
  population manager tick; level transition wiring
- `lib/entities/moots.js` — extended record (state, path, perception, hp,
  scale, tint, isBoss)
- `lib/game/state.js` — `victory` state, ammo refund rule (no refund on boss
  ram), `nextLevel` action
- `lib/config.js` — `CITY`, `NAV`, `AI`, `POP`, `BOSS`, `AMMO`, `RAM` blocks

**Delete after Phase 1 lands:**
- `lib/world/buildings.js` (replaced by `lib/world/city/buildings.js`)

## Suggested commit cadence

- Phase 0: 1 commit (generator skeleton + adapter)
- Phase 1: 2–3 commits (roads, then blocks/buildings, then sidewalks)
- Phase 2: 1 commit (nav grid + A* + moot collision)
- Phase 3: 1 commit (ambient state)
- Phase 4: 1 commit (perception + transitions)
- Phase 5: 1 commit (flee/armed/recovery behaviors)
- Phase 6: 1 commit (radar)
- Phase 7: as-needed (polish)
- Phase 8: 1 commit (population manager + spawn ring + death respawn)
- Phase 9: 2–3 commits (boss state + ammo rules; level transition;
  HUD portrait)

Each phase should leave the game runnable. Phase 0 in particular must produce
a world that's visually identical to today.
